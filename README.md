# GNBG-Instances
**MATLAB Source Code for Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG)

This repository contains the MATLAB source code for a series of predefined problem instances generated by the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG). As a demonstration, I have implemented Differential Evolution (DE) as the optimization algorithm.

Key Features:

The code is structured to work with pre-saved parameter settings for 24 distinct GNBG-generated problem instances (f1 to f24).
DE serves as an example optimizer to illustrate the application of these problem instances in optimization scenarios.

Important Note:

The actual GNBG generator code, which is essential for creating and manipulating various problem instances, is not included in this repository. It can be accessed separately at https://github.com/Danial-Yazdani/GNBG-Generator
